<!--             <p>The owner of Healey Organics was familiar with Tracey's photography style and clean aesthetic, characterised by the exclusive use of natural light â€“a look she wanted to achieve for her range of Certified Organic deodorants.</p>
            <p>The objective of these shoots was to create light imagery, with a focus on natural tones and minimalistic styling that focused on the product, and its application in a relatable way.</p> 
            <p>By providing broader licensing; and versatile compositions that work in both digital and traditional mediums, Healey Organics leveraged these assets across their brand website, social media accounts and print.</p> -->
